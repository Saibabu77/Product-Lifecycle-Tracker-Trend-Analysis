Key Insights:

1. R&D receives the largest investment
Among all the lifecycle stages, R&D has the highest allocated budget, indicating a strong focus on innovation and early-stage product development.

2. Prototype phase shows strong early revenue
Revenue during the prototype (test market) stage is quite high, suggesting positive market validation and potential for scaling.

3. Saturation and Niche Adaptation phases dominate
These two stages have some of the highest values on the chart, which may indicate that several products are either peaking in maturity or being tailored for specific markets to extend their lifespan.

4. Growth and Maturity have relatively low engagement
Both stages show significantly lower activity compared to others, which might point to either a short growth cycle or challenges in scaling products beyond early success.

5. Optimization and Decline receive similar attention
There appears to be a balanced focus between trying to improve existing products and managing products that are losing traction, suggesting a reactive as well as proactive strategy.

6. Repositioning is minimal
There is very little activity in the repositioning phase, which could imply missed opportunities to refresh declining products or shift them into new market segments.

7. Discontinuation is already budgeted
Even though discontinuation has the lowest value, it still has a measurable allocation. This shows that the team is planning for the end-of-life stage rather than treating it as an afterthought.
